## Join us Monday, January 14, 2012

We will be holding a mini-hackathon at think|haus, 25 Dundurn St N in Hamilton, at 7pm Monday to launch the Hamilton Version.

We need everyone, including people with the following skill sets:

* Developers - we want to create the best fork of Change By Us anywhere, creating a site Hamiltonians can be proud of. Our code will make the site powerful for Hamiltonians and be offered by to the main project, putting Hamilton on the open government map.
* Designers - This isn't a cheap rip-off of some template we found the Internet. We need your skills to make the user interface reflect all the beauty that is our city. Take a look at other sites using Change By Us, including [NYC](http://nyc.changebyus.org) and [Philly](http://philly.changebyus.org), as the baseline. What designer changes will make our better? See you Monday.
* City Knowledge Experts - Do you work for the City? Have you worked for the City? Are you engaged in neighbourhood associations or community groups? We need you. You our are experts on what our HamOnt version of Change By Us needs to connect to the influencers in our city to ensure the success of this project.
* Stats Gurus - There's a social science to engagement and feedback collection. We need you to ensure we create a product that will ensure our fellow citizens are being properly heard.
* Citizens - This is the most important category. This doesn't happen without you. Bring your ideas, cheer us on, and help spread the word.
